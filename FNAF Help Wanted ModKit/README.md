# Help with this Project!
 
 **This Project is simple as opening it with UE 4.21!!**

 **1. Open the .uproject and you will receive a prompt similar to the image below. Simple press yes and it should begin to compile (it has to compile because it has C++ classes and functions etc...) if you are for some reason unable to compile or cannot be bothered to use visual studio (I don't blame you) you can alternatively get the compiled binaries [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KptWQvf_zD5TNRGYDun8N1gL2MZhrvnO/view?usp=sharing)**
